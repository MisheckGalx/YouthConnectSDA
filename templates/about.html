            <p style="color: var(--gray); line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.0625rem;">
                Clayville Gardens Seventh-Day Adventist Church began as a trial Sabbath program in April 2007. 
                A small group of families initially came together for vespers and and Wednesday prayer meetings.
                The first gathering was at the Gumede household, where a gazebo was used during worship.

                As the group continued to grow, they sought mother church support from Tembisa East SDA Church.
                However, due to limited support, the group later approached Mount Calvary SDA Church, which agreed
                to mother the congregation. At that time, Pastor Rapitsi was serving as the pastor of Tembisa East.

                In 2010, under the leadership of Pastor Eddy Magerman, the congregation was officially oganized into
                a company. Mount Calvary SDA Church aknowledged that the group was already functioning as a fully 
                established church with active departments. By then, the church had acquired a 400-seater tent to
                accommmodate its growing membership.

                Over the years, the church worshiped at various locations around Clayville, including the Makhetho
                and Ncube family residences. Clayville SDA Church has been actively involved in evangelistic efforts, 
                conducting crusades, Vocational Bible School Programs, and literature distribution initiatives.

                Clayville SDA Church is a small congregation known for its close-knit, family-like atmosphere, where
                members support and nurture one another in faith. Notably, the Pathfinder and Adventurer clubs have 
                played a significant role in attracting young people from the community. Through these ministries, many 
                young participants have grown spiritually, embraced the message of the church, and eventually become 
                committed members.

                Pastors who have served the Clayville congregation include Pastor Carolus, Pastor Rossow, and Pastor Magerman,
                who is the current pastor.

                Today, Clayville SDA Church has a membership of approximately 60 and worships at Wonderland Christian School,
                located in Olifantsfontein.
